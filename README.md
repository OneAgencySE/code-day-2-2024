# Get started

- Install WSL 2 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- Install Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## Configuration

- In Docker Desktop, enable WSL integration

  - ⚙️ → Resources → WSL integration → Enable integration with my default WSL distro

- Put the docker-compose-yml file in WSL. I have cloned this repository to the following location: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\code-day-2-2024`.

## Let's go

- Navigate to the directory where you placed your docker-compose.yml file and run the command `docker-compose up -d` using your Ubuntu shell.
